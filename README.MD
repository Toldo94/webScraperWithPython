# Looking for a Job?

[Python.org](https://www.python.org/jobs/) provides us a list of an open position for Python developers.

With the `BeautifulSoup` module it's possible to collect available data form the website and do some analyses. 

In this code informations, from the website are collected and stored in a list. This way collected data are organized in compact form for future use.

This data can be used to filter interested options or collected data can be used to generate content for other websites (links to the original websites are collected).
